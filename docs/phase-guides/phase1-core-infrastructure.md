# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

## Goal
Create a basic functional layout with mocked data and clean navigation that serves as the foundation for all future phases.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up tech stack
  - [ ] Initialize Next.js project
  - [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
  - [ ] Set up mock backend or JSON server for data
  - [ ] Configure project structure (pages, components, data)

- [ ] Implement navigation
  - [ ] Create sidebar with 4 main tabs: Explore, Portfolio, Trading, Watchlist
  - [ ] Add active state indicators
  - [ ] Implement mobile-responsive navigation

- [ ] Create placeholder pages
  - [ ] Explore page (Property Marketplace)
  - [ ] Portfolio page (Holdings)
  - [ ] Trading page (Secondary Market)
  - [ ] Watchlist page

- [ ] Build reusable components
  - [ ] PropertyCard (basic version)
  - [ ] ModalWindow component
  - [ ] ChartComponent (placeholder)
  - [ ] FilterBar component
  - [ ] Button components

- [ ] Mock data
  - [ ] Create JSON file with property data (20+ properties)
  - [ ] Include fields: name, location, score, price, yield, appreciation

## Boundaries and Constraints
- Focus ONLY on structure and navigation - no complex functionality
- Use placeholder/skeleton content where appropriate
- Keep styling minimal but consistent
- Don't implement filtering logic yet
- Charts should be placeholders with static data

## Definition of Done
- Navigation works between all pages
- Basic layout is responsive
- Property data loads from mock source
- Placeholder components render correctly
- Project structure follows best practices
