# Phase 7: AI Mock Integration

## Goal
Simulate AI-powered property scoring and personalized recommendations to demonstrate how intelligent features will enhance the platform experience.

## Tasks
- [ ] Score Breakdown Implementation
  - [ ] Create detailed score breakdown sections in property cards
  - [ ] Display subscores for key metrics (Risk, Yield, Appreciation, etc.)
  - [ ] Add visual indicators for score components
  - [ ] Include brief explanations for scores

- [ ] Recommendation Engine
  - [ ] Implement "Atlas Recommends" property strip/carousel
  - [ ] Create categorized recommendations (High Yield, Undervalued, Safe Growth)
  - [ ] Add personalized suggestion logic based on browsing history
  - [ ] Include explanation for why properties are recommended

- [ ] AI Tag Filtering
  - [ ] Create AI-powered tag system for properties
  - [ ] Implement tag-based filtering
  - [ ] Add tag visualization in property cards
  - [ ] Create tooltips explaining tag meanings

- [ ] Score History (Optional)
  - [ ] Add historical score tracking visualization
  - [ ] Create score change indicators
  - [ ] Implement score change notifications

## Boundaries and Constraints
- All AI features are simulated with fixed logic and mocked data
- Don't implement actual machine learning models
- Keep recommendations relevant and based on clear criteria
- Limit the number of subscores to maintain clarity (3-5 maximum)
- Focus on explaining the "why" behind scores and recommendations

## Definition of Done
- Property cards show detailed score breakdowns
- Recommendation strip displays personalized property suggestions
- AI tags are visible and filterable
- Score explanations are clear and understandable
- System feels intelligent but not magical or arbitrary
