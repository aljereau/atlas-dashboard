# Phase 4: Trading MVP

## Goal
Create a simulated trading interface that allows users to buy and sell property tokens, with price charts and market statistics.

## Tasks
- [ ] Price Chart Implementation
  - [ ] Create line or bar chart for token price history
  - [ ] Add time period selectors (day, week, month, year)
  - [ ] Display key price points (open, close, high, low)
  - [ ] Implement chart legends and tooltips

- [ ] Buy/Sell Form
  - [ ] Create input form for transaction amount (€ or tokens)
  - [ ] Add real-time calculated values (tokens for € and vice versa)
  - [ ] Implement transaction type toggle (buy/sell)
  - [ ] Add validation for inputs
  - [ ] Create summary of transaction details

- [ ] Transaction Confirmation
  - [ ] Implement modal for transaction confirmation
  - [ ] Show transaction details and fees
  - [ ] Add success/failure states
  - [ ] Create confirmation animation/feedback

- [ ] Market Statistics
  - [ ] Display number of token holders
  - [ ] Show trading volume statistics
  - [ ] Add liquidity indicators
  - [ ] Create trend indicators for market activity

## Boundaries and Constraints
- All transactions are simulated - no real blockchain integration
- Use fixed mock data for price history
- Keep transaction process simple (no complex order types)
- Market statistics should be static but realistic
- Focus on clarity and simplicity of the trading interface

## Definition of Done
- Users can view price charts with different time periods
- Buy/sell form calculates correct values based on input
- Transaction confirmation works with simulated success/failure
- Market statistics display correctly
- Interface is intuitive and accessible for non-experts
