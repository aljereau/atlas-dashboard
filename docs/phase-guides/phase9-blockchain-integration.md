# Phase 9: Blockchain Integration

## Goal
Implement real blockchain connectivity to enable actual token transactions, ownership verification, and on-chain data retrieval, transforming the application from a simulation to a functional tokenized real estate platform.

## Tasks
- [ ] Local Blockchain Setup
  - [ ] Implement local test blockchain environment (Hardhat/Ganache)
  - [ ] Create and deploy simple property tokenization smart contracts
  - [ ] Set up basic wallet connectivity
  - [ ] Add transaction signing capabilities

- [ ] Smart Contract Implementation
  - [ ] Property token (ERC-721/ERC-1155) contracts
  - [ ] Ownership registry for properties
  - [ ] Simple marketplace contracts for buying/selling
  - [ ] Transaction history recording

- [ ] Wallet Integration
  - [ ] Add support for MetaMask/Web3 wallet connection
  - [ ] Implement account display and connection status
  - [ ] Create transaction signing flow
  - [ ] Add wallet balance display

- [ ] On-Chain Data Integration
  - [ ] Fetch property ownership data from blockchain
  - [ ] Connect transaction history to on-chain events
  - [ ] Implement real-time transaction status updates
  - [ ] Add block confirmations display

## Boundaries and Constraints
- Use a local test blockchain for development - not mainnet
- Create simplified smart contracts focusing on core functionality
- Maintain the existing UI but connect it to real blockchain data
- Don't implement complex tokenomics or advanced contract features
- Focus on a smooth Web3 user experience, not blockchain complexity

## Definition of Done
- Users can connect their Web3 wallet to the application
- Property tokens can be transferred on the blockchain
- Transaction history pulls from actual on-chain events
- Portfolio displays real token ownership from the blockchain
- The entire buy/sell flow is connected to smart contracts
