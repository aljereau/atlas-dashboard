# Phase 5: Watchlist and Notes

## Goal
Implement a user research and tracking system that allows saving properties of interest and adding personal notes for future reference.

## Tasks
- [ ] Watchlist View Implementation
  - [ ] Create dedicated watchlist page
  - [ ] Display saved properties in list/grid format
  - [ ] Add sorting and filtering for watchlist items
  - [ ] Implement "Remove from Watchlist" functionality
  - [ ] Show key metrics for watchlisted properties

- [ ] Notes Feature
  - [ ] Add notes section for each property
  - [ ] Create text editor for note input
  - [ ] Implement save/update functionality for notes
  - [ ] Display last edited timestamp
  - [ ] Add character/word count indicators

- [ ] Property Save Functionality
  - [ ] Ensure "Save to Watchlist" buttons work on all property cards
  - [ ] Add visual confirmation when saving/removing
  - [ ] Create consistent saved state indicators across platform
  - [ ] Implement local storage for persistence
  
- [ ] Export Feature (Optional)
  - [ ] Add export functionality for watchlist
  - [ ] Create PDF or CSV export options
  - [ ] Include notes in exports
  - [ ] Add export confirmation

## Boundaries and Constraints
- Use local storage for data persistence (no backend required)
- Keep note editor simple (basic text formatting only)
- Don't implement sharing or collaboration features
- Limit export options to common formats only
- Focus on personal user utility over advanced features

## Definition of Done
- Users can add and remove properties from watchlist
- Notes can be added, edited, and saved for each property
- Watchlist displays all saved properties with key information
- Data persists between sessions using local storage
- Export function works (if implemented)
