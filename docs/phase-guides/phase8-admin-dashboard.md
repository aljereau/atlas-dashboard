# Phase 8: Admin Dashboard (Optional)

## Goal
Create a basic admin interface for managing properties, monitoring user engagement, and controlling the platform content.

## Tasks
- [ ] Admin Table View
  - [ ] Create administrative table of all properties
  - [ ] Add search and filter functionality
  - [ ] Implement quick-edit capabilities
  - [ ] Add status indicators for properties
  - [ ] Create sorting and pagination

- [ ] Property Management
  - [ ] Implement "Add New Property" form
  - [ ] Create property editing interface
  - [ ] Add property activation/deactivation toggle
  - [ ] Implement property deletion with safeguards
  - [ ] Add image upload/management

- [ ] Engagement Analytics
  - [ ] Create basic analytics dashboard
  - [ ] Display property view counts
  - [ ] Show saved/watchlist metrics
  - [ ] Add mock user engagement statistics
  - [ ] Implement analytics timeframe selection

- [ ] Admin Authentication (Optional)
  - [ ] Add basic admin login screen
  - [ ] Create role-based access control
  - [ ] Implement secure routes
  - [ ] Add session management

## Boundaries and Constraints
- Keep analytics data mocked but realistic
- Focus on property management over user management
- Maintain simple, functional design - less polish than user-facing pages
- Don't implement complex database operations
- Use local storage for persistence (optional simple backend)

## Definition of Done
- Admin can view, add, edit, and manage properties
- Basic engagement metrics are displayed
- Property management functions work correctly
- Interface is functional and straightforward
- Admin actions persist between sessions (via local storage)
