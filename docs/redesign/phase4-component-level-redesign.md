## Testing Approach
*How will you test each component after redesign?*

```
[Describe testing strategy - which browsers, devices, test cases, etc.]
```

## Implementation Strategy
*How will you manage the implementation of these changes?*

- [ ] All at once
- [ ] Phased approach by component group
- [ ] One component at a time
- [ ] Other: [describe]
