# Atlas Dashboard MVP - Development Guide

This directory contains structured guides for the sequential development of the Atlas User Dashboard MVP. The project is divided into 8 distinct phases, each building upon the previous to create a comprehensive tokenized real estate investment platform interface.

## Project Overview

The Atlas User Dashboard is a sleek, modular MVP that mimics the look and feel of a modern stock trading platform for tokenized real estate investment. It enables users to:

- Explore properties with detailed metrics and AI scores
- View their portfolio and performance statistics
- Simulate trading of property tokens
- Track properties of interest with a watchlist and notes
- Experience AI-driven recommendations

## Phase Guide Directory

Our development follows a strict sequential approach, with each phase having clear goals, tasks, and boundaries:

1. [Core Infrastructure](phase-guides/phase1-core-infrastructure.md) - Setting up the foundation

3. [Portfolio MVP](phase-guides/phase3-portfolio-mvp.md) - Creating the holdings view
4. [Trading MVP](phase-guides/phase4-trading-mvp.md) - Implementing token trading

## Using These Guides

- Each phase guide contains a checklist of tasks
- Reference the "Boundaries and Constraints" section to avoid overbuilding
- Check items off as they're completed
- Only move to the next phase when all items are completed and the "Definition of Done" criteria are met

## Tech Stack

- React (Next.js)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Mock data (JSON)
